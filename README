To compile make sure you have all of my files in the same folder.
This includes all of the header files:
nicolacorbin_selectionsort.h, nicolacorbin_bubblesort.h, nicolacorbin_insertionsort.h, nicolacorbin_mergesort.h,
nicolacorbin_quicksort.h, and nicolacorbin_heapsort.h

As well as the main file nicolacorbin_main.cpp. You should have my executable file included as well.

In the terminal make sure you are in the folder "nicolacorbin_code" with my files.

COPY (or type): g++ nicolacorbin_main.cpp -o nicolacorbin_main

PASTE it in the command line terminal and press enter

It should have created an executable file nicolacorbin_main

Type in: ./nicolacorbin_main in the command line and press enter.

This should execute the program.
